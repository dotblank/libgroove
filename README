what is it?
==========

libgroove is a high level Qt API to access data and music on the excellent
Grooveshark (http://listen.grooveshark.com) service.

is this legal?
=============

Short version:
It is probably a good idea to seek legal advice before writing something
using libgroove.

Long version:
I am not aware of any legal complications arising from libgroove, but it
certainly is not wise to expect there to not be any.

I did not reverse-engineer Grooveshark, I based much of my knowledge upon
the work of earlier pioneers to the field, in particular, Daniel Danopia's
work on remora (http://github.com/danopia/remora) and Elias Woods' Maemo
Grooveshark client were both quite useful.

You should very carefully read and take notice of Grooveshark's ToS
(http://www.grooveshark.com/terms), one thing in particular to keep in mind
is that Grooveshark explicitly disallow any storage of data from their
service.

If someone from Grooveshark happens to stumble across this, let me first say
that I am a great fan of your service. If you are unhappy with libgroove for
some reason, I am more than happy to work with you to improve on things.
